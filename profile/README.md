Hey! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome at the GitHub organisation of Serlo Education!
We follow the mission that education shall be diverse, free and open for everyone.
Everbody shall be able to fufill his or her potential in the educational system â€“ regardless of the
financial possibilities or the social background.

Thus we have created and further improve the website https://serlo.org â€“ a wiki for educational material.
Everybody can create and edit learning material (articles, courses, videos, exercises, ...).
As open educational resources they can be used, shared and modified by everbody (similar to open source).
