<img width="75%" alt="The team of Serlo Education e.V." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serlo/.github/main/assets/serlo-team.jpg" />

Hey! 👋 Welcome to Serlo Education's GitHub!<br/> Our vision is a diverse, free and
open education for everyone. Everybody should be able to fufill their potential
in the educational system – regardless of financial possibilities or
social background.

We work on [serlo.org](https://serlo.org) – a learning plattform with a wiki
approach. <br/> On **serlo.org** anybody can create and edit learning
materials (articles, courses, videos, exercises, ...). Similar to open source code 
those then can be used, shared and modified by everybody.
Currently we reach over 1 million users per month.

## Our core values

We are a passionate team and community of diverse people who believe in the
following core values:

- 🚀 **Impact:** Our mission is nothing less than providing excellent education
  to everyone for free. Everywhere in the world!
- 🥰 **Work with a purpose:** Everybody in our team takes responsibility for our
  mission. Every day we make a (little) contribution to a more just world.
- 🎉 **Having fun:** Work should be fun! We take care of each other and our
  mental and physical health. We celebrate our progress.
- ✨ **New work – the right way:** We lead together in an efficient and agile
  way. We create space to allow everyone to work in their area of responsibility.
- 🤝 **Together:** We teach, empower and inspire each other. We can only achieve
  our mission of educational equality as a team and together with other
  organisations.
