Hey! üëã Welcome to Serlo Education's GitHub!<br/> Our vision is a diverse, free
and open education for everyone. Everybody should be able to fulfill their
potential in the educational system ‚Äì regardless of financial possibilities or
social background.

Thus we have build **[serlo.org](https://serlo.org)** ‚Äì a learning platform with
a wiki approach. On it anybody can create and edit learning materials (articles,
courses, videos, exercises, ...). Similar to open source code those then can be
used, shared and modified by everybody. Currently we reach over 1 million users
per month.

## Our core values

We are a passionate team and community of diverse people who believe in the
following core values:

- üöÄ **Impact:** Our mission is to provide excellent education to everyone for
  free - everywhere in the world!
- ü•∞ **Work with a purpose:** Everybody in our team takes responsibility for our
  mission. Every day we make a (little) contribution to more equity in the
  world.
- üéâ **Having fun:** Work should be fun! We take care of each other and our
  mental and physical health. We celebrate our progress.
- ‚ú® **New work ‚Äì the right way:** We lead together in an efficient and agile
  way. We create space to allow everyone to work in their area of
  responsibility.
- ü§ù **Together:** We teach, empower and inspire each other. We can only achieve
  our mission of educational equality as a team and together with other
  organisations.
