Hey! üëã Welcome at the GitHub organisation of Serlo Education!
We follow the mission that education shall be diverse, free and open for everyone.
Everbody shall be able to fufill his or her potential in the educational system ‚Äì regardless of the
financial possibilities or the social background.

Thus we have created and further improve the website https://serlo.org ‚Äì a wiki for educational material.
Everybody can create and edit learning material (articles, courses, videos, exercises, ...).
As open educational resources they can be used, shared and modified by everbody (similar to open source).

## Our core values

* üöÄ **Impact:** Our mission is nothing less than providing excellent education for free to everyone and everywhere on the world!

* üéâ **Having fun:** Work always shall be fun! We take care of ourselfes and celebrate our progress.
* ‚ú® **New work ‚Äì the right way:** We lead together in a efficient and agile way. We give space so that everybody can  work on one's own responsibility.
