![The team of Serlo Education e.V.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serlo/.github/main/assets/serlo-team.jpg)

Hey! 👋 Welcome at the GitHub organisation of Serlo Education! We follow the
mission that education shall be diverse, free and open for everyone. Everbody
shall be able to fufill his or her potential in the educational system –
regardless of the financial possibilities or the social background.

Thus we have created and further improve the website https://serlo.org – a wiki
for educational material. On this website everybody can create and edit learning
material (articles, courses, videos, exercises, ...). As open educational
resources they can be used, shared and modified by everbody (similar to open
source). Currently we reach over 1 million user per month.

## Our core values

We are a passionate team and community of diverse people who believe in the
following core values:

- 🚀 **Impact:** Our mission is nothing less than providing excellent education
  for free to everyone and everywhere on the world!
- 🥰 **Work with purpose:** Everybody in our team takes responsibility for our
  mission. Each day we make a (little) impact for a more just world.
- 🎉 **Having fun:** Work always shall be fun! We take care of ourselfes and our
  mental and physical health. We celebrate our progress.
- ✨ **New work – the right way:** We lead together in an efficient and agile
  way. We give space so that everybody can work on one's own responsibility.
- 🤝 **Together:** We teach, empower and inspire each other. We can only achieve
  our mission of educational equity together in a team and together with other
  organisations.
